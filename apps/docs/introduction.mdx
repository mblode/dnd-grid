## Usage

```tsx
import { DndGrid } from "@dnd-grid/react";
import "@dnd-grid/react/styles.css";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <DndGrid
      cols={12}
      rowHeight={50}
      width={1200}
      layout={[
        { i: "a", x: 0, y: 0, w: 4, h: 2 },
        { i: "b", x: 4, y: 0, w: 4, h: 2 },
      ]}
    >
      <div key="a">Item A</div>
      <div key="b">Item B</div>
    </DndGrid>
  );
}
```

## Key features

- **Drag and resize:** Configurable handles and smooth interactions.
- **Responsive layouts:** Helpers for breakpoints and container width.
- **Compaction and constraints:** Control packing, collisions, and bounds.
- **Styling hooks:** CSS variables, data attributes, and item state helpers.

## Core engine vs React adapter

`@dnd-grid/core` is the headless layout engine. It owns the layout math,
compaction, constraints, and the command-based `createLayoutEngine` API with no
DOM or React dependencies. `@dnd-grid/react` is the adapter that handles DOM
measurements, drag/resize events, transforms, focus/a11y, and styling.

Use `@dnd-grid/core` if you want to build a custom adapter for another runtime.
Otherwise, consume `@dnd-grid/react` for the full React experience.
