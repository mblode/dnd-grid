`dnd-grid` is safe to render on the server, but it needs a width on the client.
Use the patterns below to avoid layout jumps and hydration warnings.

## Use a client component

`DndGrid` relies on DOM events and `ResizeObserver`. In Next.js App Router,
render it in a client component:

```tsx
"use client";

import { DndGrid } from "@dnd-grid/react";
```

## Measure width after mount

```tsx
import { useContainerWidth } from "@dnd-grid/react";

const { width, containerRef, mounted } = useContainerWidth({
  measureBeforeMount: true,
  initialWidth: 800,
});

return (
  <div ref={containerRef}>
    {mounted && width > 0 && <DndGrid width={width} {...props} />}
  </div>
);
```

## Prefer AutoWidthDndGrid when possible

`AutoWidthDndGrid` wraps the same logic and avoids wiring the hook yourself.

## Keep styles global

Make sure the stylesheet is imported from a client entry or global CSS:

```tsx
import "@dnd-grid/react/styles.css";
```
