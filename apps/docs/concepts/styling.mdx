## Why are styles required?

The `@dnd-grid/react/styles.css` file contains critical layout and interaction logic. Without it:

- **Layout will break:** Grid items won't be positioned correctly.
- **No Animations:** Items won't slide into place when others are moved.
- **Invisible Handles:** Resize handles will be missing or misplaced.
- **Broken Placeholders:** The "shadow" box during drag won't be visible.

```tsx
import "@dnd-grid/react/styles.css";
```

## CSS Variables

`dnd-grid` uses CSS variables for easy theming. You can override these in your global CSS or on a specific grid container.

```css
:root {
  --dnd-grid-radius: 24px;
  --dnd-grid-placeholder-bg: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  --dnd-grid-handle-bg: #ffffff;
}
```

### Reference

| Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--dnd-grid-radius` | `24px` | Border radius for grid items and the placeholder. |
| `--dnd-grid-placeholder-bg` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.012)` | Background color of the drop placeholder. |
| `--dnd-grid-handle-bg` | `#ffffff` | Color of the default resize handle. |

## Customizing Items

Grid items use `.dnd-grid-item` for layout. Non-placeholder items also include
`.dnd-grid-item-content` so you can target visual styling without affecting the placeholder:

```css
/* Custom item styling */
.dnd-grid-item-content {
  background: white;
  border: 1px solid #e2e8f0;
  box-shadow: 0 1px 3px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

/* Style items while they are being dragged */
.dnd-grid-item.dnd-draggable-dragging {
  box-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  z-index: 10;
}
```

## Theming Tips

### Dark Mode

You can use a media query or a class-based approach (like Tailwind) to update variables for dark mode.

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --dnd-grid-placeholder-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
    --dnd-grid-handle-bg: #1a202c;
  }
}
```

### Item States

Use these classes to target specific states of a grid item:

- `.dnd-draggable-dragging`: Active when an item is being moved.
- `.resizing`: Active when an item is being resized.
- `.dnd-grid-placeholder`: The preview box that appears during drag/resize.
- `.is-hovered`: Active when the mouse is over an item.

### Custom Resize Handles

If you want to completely replace the resize handle UI, you can pass a custom component to the `resizeHandle` prop on `DndGrid`:

```tsx
<DndGrid
  resizeHandle={<div className="my-custom-handle" />}
  // ...
/>
```
