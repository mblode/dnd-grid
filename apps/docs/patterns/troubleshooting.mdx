## The grid is empty or items do not render

- Ensure every child `key` matches a layout item `i`.
- Pass a non-zero `width` to `DndGrid` (use `useContainerWidth` if needed).
- Make sure each layout item has `w` and `h` greater than 0.

## Dragging or resizing does not work

- Check `isDraggable` and `isResizable` on the grid and items.
- `static: true` disables drag and resize.
- Make sure `dragHandle` and `dragCancel` selectors match your DOM.

## Resize handles are missing

- Import `@dnd-grid/react/styles.css`.
- Verify `resizeHandles` is not empty and the item is resizable.

## Layout jumps on hydration

- Use `useContainerWidth({ measureBeforeMount: true })` and render once mounted.
- Provide a stable `initialWidth` that matches your container.

## Auto-scroll does not trigger

- Ensure the scroll container has `overflow: auto` or `scroll`.
- Pass `autoScroll` options to adjust `threshold` and `activator`.
- Use `AutoScrollActivator.DraggableRect` if pointer coordinates are unreliable.

## Items overlap unexpectedly

- Use a non-overlap compactor like `verticalCompactor` or `horizontalCompactor`.
- Avoid `allowOverlap` variants unless you want stacking.
- Set `preventCollision` if you want drag moves to be blocked.
