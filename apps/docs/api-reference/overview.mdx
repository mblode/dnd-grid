## Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`DndGrid`](/api-reference/dnd-grid) | Main grid layout component |
| [`ResponsiveDndGrid`](/api-reference/responsive-dnd-grid) | Breakpoint-aware responsive grid |

Most apps should start with `DndGrid` for single-layout grids and
`ResponsiveDndGrid` for breakpoint layouts. Use
[`useDndGrid`](/hooks/use-dnd-grid) when you need a custom wrapper or want to
control rendering.
Both components measure their container width automatically.

Also exported: `FixedWidthDndGrid` (explicit width), `GridItem`, and
`ResizeHandle`.

## Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`useContainerWidth`](/hooks/use-container-width) | Measure container width with ResizeObserver |
| [`useDndGrid`](/hooks/use-dnd-grid) | Headless hook for building custom grid wrappers |
| [`useDndGridResponsiveLayout`](/hooks/use-dnd-grid-responsive-layout) | Manage responsive breakpoints + layout state |
| [`useDndGridItemState`](/hooks/use-dnd-grid-item-state) | Access item layout and interaction state |
| [`useEdgeScroll`](/hooks/use-edge-scroll) | Auto-scroll while dragging near scroll edges |

## Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`Layout`](/api-reference/layout-item#layout) | Array of layout items (`LayoutItem[]`) |
| [`LayoutItem`](/api-reference/layout-item) | Position and size of a single grid item |
| `ResponsiveLayouts` | Breakpoint → layout map |
| `Compactor` | Pluggable compaction strategy |
| `LayoutConstraint` | Drag/resize constraint definition |
| `GridDragEvent` | Event object for drag callbacks |
| `GridResizeEvent` | Event object for resize callbacks |

## Additional exports

`@dnd-grid/react` also exports:

- `useOptionalDndGridItemState` and `useReducedMotion`
- `createLayoutEngine` and layout engine types for headless usage

## Runtime validation

`layoutSchema`, `layoutItemSchema`, and `validateLayout` use Zod to validate
layouts at runtime. `DndGrid` and `useDndGrid` also expose a `validation` prop
(default: enabled in dev, disabled in production) to fail fast on bad layouts.
Validation adds runtime work and bundle weight, so keep it off in hot paths if
you do not need it.

## CSS classes

Common classes you can target:

| Class | Element |
|-------|---------|
| `.dnd-grid` | Grid container |
| `.dnd-grid-item` | Each grid item |
| `.dnd-grid-item-content` | Non-placeholder grid items |
| `.dnd-grid-placeholder` | Placeholder during drag/resize |
| `.dnd-draggable-dragging` | Item currently being dragged |
| `.resizing` | Item currently being resized |

## Quick reference

### Essential props

```tsx
<DndGrid
  layout={layout}
  cols={12}
  rowHeight={150}
  onLayoutChange={(layout) => {}}
>
  {children}
</DndGrid>
```

```tsx
<ResponsiveDndGrid
  layouts={layouts}
  breakpoints={{ lg: 1200, md: 996, sm: 768, xs: 480, xxs: 0 }}
  cols={{ lg: 12, md: 10, sm: 6, xs: 4, xxs: 2 }}
